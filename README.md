# Game-of-life
Basic game of life implementation.

This implementation was designed in pythonista (Ipad environnement) using the Scene library. 

There is 2 files : 

Game of life : This is the main file where the content is drawned on the screen

GOL : This is an implementation of the heart of the game (check and update neighbors). 

In addition A,B,C are matrix implemented in the code with nice output (a crawaler, and graphically pleasing start points).
